DB-Color

Syntax highlighting for the Perl debugger.

Want this?
http://blogs.perl.org/users/ovid/2010/11/syntax-highlighting-for-the-perl-debugger.html

Then add this to your $HOME/.perldb

 use DB::Color;

Then use your debugger like normal:

 perl -d some_file.pl

If you don't want a $HOME/.perldb file:

 perl -MDB::Color -d some_file.pl

See perldoc DB::Color for more information.

This code is a proof of concept and is buggy. The syntax highlighting is
buggy. Fix it :)
