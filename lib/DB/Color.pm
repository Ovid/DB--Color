=head1 NAME

DB::Color - Colorize your debugger output

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.06

=cut

our $VERSION = '0.06';

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Put the following in your $HOME/.perldb file:

 sub afterinit {
     push @DB::typeahead, "{{v"
       unless $DB::already_curly_curly_v++;
 }
 use DB::Color;

Then use your debugger like normal:

 perl -d some_file.pl

=head1 DISABLING COLOR

If the NO_DB_COLOR environment variable is set to a true value, syntax
highlighting will be disabled.

=head1 PERFORMANCE

Syntax highlighting the code is very, very slow. As a result, we cache the
output files in F<$HOME/.perldbcolor>. This is done by calculating the md5 sum
of the file contents. If the file is changed, we get a new sum. This means
that syntax highlighting is very slow at first, but every time you hit the
same file, assuming its unchnanged, the cached version is served first.

Note that the cache files are never removed. This has merely been a naive hack
for a proof of concept. Patches welcome.

=head1 ALPHA

This is only a proof of concept. In fact, it's fair to say that this code
sucks. It's not very configurable and has bugs. It's also going to possibly be
a memory hog, as if the debugger wasn't bad enough already.
