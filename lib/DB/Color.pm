=head1 NAME

DB::Color - Colorize your debugger output

=head1 VERSION

Version 0.06

=cut

our $VERSION = '0.06';

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Put the following in your $HOME/.perldb file:

 sub afterinit {
     push @DB::typeahead, "{{v"
       unless $DB::already_curly_curly_v++;
 }
 use DB::Color;

Then use your debugger like normal:

 perl -d some_file.pl

=head1 DISABLING COLOR

If the NO_DB_COLOR environment variable is set to a true value, syntax
highlighting will be disabled.

=head1 ALPHA

This is only a proof of concept. In fact, it's fair to say that this code
sucks. It's not very configurable and has bugs. It's also going to possibly be
a memory hog, as if the debugger wasn't bad enough already.

=cut

my $HIGHLIGHTER = DB::Color::Highlight::highlighter();
my %COLORED;

sub import {
    return if $ENV{NO_DB_COLOR};
    my $old_db = \&DB::DB;

    my $new_DB = sub {
        my $lvl = 0;
        while ( my ($pkg) = caller( $lvl++ ) ) {
            return if $pkg eq "DB" or $pkg =~ /^DB::/;
        }
        my ( $package, $filename ) = caller;

        # syntax highlight everything and cache it
        my $lines = $COLORED{$package}{$filename} ||= do {
            no strict 'refs';

            # quick hack
            no warnings 'uninitialized';
            my $code = join "" => @{"::_<$filename"};
            [
                map { "$_\n" }
                  split /\n/ => $HIGHLIGHTER->highlightText($code)
            ];
        };

        # lie to the debugger about what the lines of code are
        {
            no strict 'refs';
            @{"::_<$filename"} = @$lines;
        }
        goto $old_db;
    };

    {
        no warnings 'redefine';
        *DB::DB = $new_DB;
    }

    return;
}
